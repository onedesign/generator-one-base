# Gulp Generator

This is a yeoman generator to setup a gulp build process based on One Design Company standard structure.

## What it does

1. Adds a `gulpfile.js` gulp entry point
2. Adds a `gulp/` directory with a bunch of pre-defined tasks for building, linting, compressing, and compiling
3. Adds standard `.gitignore` entries
