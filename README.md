# generator-one-base

A foundation for One Design Company projects on the web.

## Features

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)-based build process that handles style, javascript, and image compilation and optimization with lots of nice features baked right in.
- SCSS-based style structure with all of the base styles and tools you need to hit the ground running.
- Modular Javascript setup powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) and support for next-generation syntax via [Babel](https://babeljs.io)
- Installs latest versions of all development tools and optional frontend libraries via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
- Development server with live reload, powered by [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io) that can optionally proxy an existing URL.
- Pull Request template for consistent pull requests
- Pre-commit hook that checks for commonly used logging functions and doesn't allow you to commit when they are present.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [yo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo)

### via npm linkâ€¦

You can clone this repo and use `npm link` to use the cloned repo as your global version of `generator-one-base`

```bash
git clone git@github.com:onedesign/generator-one-base.git
cd generator-one-base
npm link
```

## Use

Generate your new project:

```bash
yo one-base
```

## Gulp Sub-Generator

If you want to add or update the gulp setup for an existing project (or a project previously created with `generator-one-base`) you can use the `gulp` sub-generator on its own:

```bash
cd project/to/run/generator
yo one-base:gulp
```

**Use with existing projects:** If you want to run this in a directory with an existing gulp setup, you _might_ want to run it using the `--force` flag (`yo one-base:gulp --force`) to force it to overwrite any existing files. Before you do this though, make absolutely sure that you have the existing files committed in git or saved in some other way, or they will be lost forever.
